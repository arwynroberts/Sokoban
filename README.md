Sokoban

1 - Sokoban Haskell Live Coding

Code from my haskell live coding session of the game Sokoban in haskell.

The challenge was [Ruby Quiz #5](http://www.rubyquiz.com/quiz5.html) - Sokoban.

Currently it is a bland console version without any bells and whistles, but in a second coding session I will add GTK2HS support and snazzy graphics.

You can watch the live coding video and many more at [Haskell Uncut](http://www.youtube.com/user/entirelysubjective)
